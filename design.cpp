# Unlike Bitcoin, nodes do not know the entire chain - instead they only hold the last 8640 shares (the last 3 day's worth). In order to prevent an attacker from working on a chain in secret and then releasing it, overriding the existing chain, chains are judged by how much work they have since a point in the past. To ascertain that the work has been done since that point, nodes look at the Bitcoin blocks that the shares reference, establishing a provable timestamp. (If a share points to a block, it was definitely made after that block was made.)

# Payout logic
# Each share contains a generation transaction that pays to the previous n shares, where n is the number of shares whose total work is equal to 3 times the average work required to solve a block, or 8640 (= 72 hours of shares), whichever is smaller. Payouts are weighted based on the amount of work each share took to solve, which is proportional to the p2pool difficulty at that time.

# The block reward (currently 12.5BTC) and the transaction fees are combined and apportioned according to these rules:

# A subsidy of 0.5% is sent to the node that solved the block in order to discourage not sharing solutions that qualify as a block. (A miner with the aim to harm others could withhold the block, thereby preventing anybody from getting paid. He can NOT redirect the payout to himself.) The remaining 99.5% is distributed evenly to miners based on work done recently.

# In the event that a share qualifies as a block, this generation transaction is exposed to the Bitcoin network and takes effect, transferring each node its payout.

# Long polling
# Long polling is a method used by some Bitcoin pools by which notifications are sent to all miners when a valid block has been generated and added to the blockchain. This serves the purpose of stopping work on the old block and beginning to work on a fresh block, thus reducing the production of stale shares.

# Without long polling, if a miner was in the middle of an assigned workload when a new block was discovered by someone else, it would continue working on the old obsolete block solution until it was finished - thus wasting effort.

# Lightning P2Pool proposal
# The existing p2pool has issues with dust. As more miners join the pool each individual miners payout becomes smaller, so eventually the cost to spend such outputs become significant. Lightning p2pool is an idea which would result in p2pool share payouts being sent over payment channels[3][4].
